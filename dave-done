-Github account, repo forked, basics set up
-Some research into pattern-finding and statistical analysis

Possible Approaches To Explore:

--Existing Software (Weka -- open-source, statistical analysis)--

Hey, it already exists.  All we'd have to do is invest a bit of time 
in playing around with it, to see if that sort of existing software 
could help our cause (and short-cut us to the $$$PROFIT$$$ stage.


--Baysian/other machine-learning algorithms--

Could be promising if we write our own Bayesian classifier (something 
I've thought about doing for fun anyway).  We could hack around with 
a tried-and-true Bayes implementation like SpamAssassin to test 
potential effectiveness.
