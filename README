This is a project to leverage the supreme handicapping abilities of Bill (as well as learning MySQL,
Python, and other fun stuff)

The project plan needs to evolve as such:

1.) Explain to Dave what horse racing is and why each of the data elements are relevent
2.) Model the database to maximize the leverage gained from the information and minimize the number of times
    we're going to have to re-do the damn thing.
3.) Dissect the XML provided in the reference files.
4.) Design an XSLT sheet and figure out to how to import the data into the database in an easy and automated fashion
5.) Have Bill develop relevant statistics gathering processes for the data.
6.) Once we have the data, develop a hypothesis about the relationship between the data and the odds of victory
7.) Write the code to model the theory
8.) Backtest the model against old race data
9.) Repeat steps 6-8.
10.) ????
11.) PROFIT!
